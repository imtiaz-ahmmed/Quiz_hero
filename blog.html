        <p class="text-lg">

            <b>map:</b> The map method returns a new array that is the result of applying a function to each element of
            an existing array. It creates a new array with the same length as the original array, where each element is
            the result of the function applied to the corresponding element in the original array. <br>

            <b>filter: </b> The filter method returns a new array containing all elements of an existing array that pass
            a test specified by a function. It creates a new array with only the elements that satisfy the specified
            condition. <br>

            <b>forEach:</b> The forEach method iterates over an array and executes a callback function on each element
            of the array. It does not return a new array; instead, it performs an action on each element of the array.
            <br>

            <b>find:</b> The find method returns the first element of an array that satisfies a specified condition. It
            returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition. <br>

            In summary, map and filter create new arrays, while forEach does not. find returns a single element of an
            array that satisfies a condition, while map and filter can return multiple elements.

        <h1 class="text-3xl text-green-600 my-3">Difference Between Local Storage, Section Storage and Cookies</h1>

        <p class="text-lg">
            Local storage, session storage, and cookies are all mechanisms for storing data in the browser, but they
            differ in their purpose and behavior.<br>

            <b>Cookies:</b>
            Cookies are small text files that are stored on the client-side (browser) and are used to store
            user-specific information like user preferences, login status, and shopping cart information. Cookies can be
            set to expire after a specified time or when the user closes the browser. <br>
            <b>Local Storage:</b>
            Local storage is a web storage API that allows data to be stored in the browser beyond the lifetime of a
            session (even after the browser is closed). Local storage is intended to store large amounts of data that
            needs to be accessed frequently by the web application. It is more secure than cookies because it is not
            sent to the server with every request, and it can only be accessed by the web application that created it.
            <br>

            <b>Session Storage:</b>
            Session storage is similar to local storage in that it is also a web storage API, but it is intended to
            store data for a single session only. Session storage is deleted when the user closes the browser or the
            tab. It is useful for storing temporary data that is needed for a specific session, like shopping cart
            information. <br>

            In summary, cookies are used for small amounts of data that need to be sent to the server with every
            request, local storage is used for large amounts of data that need to be accessed frequently by the web
            application, and session storage is used for temporary data that is needed for a single session.

        <h1 class="text-3xl text-green-600 my-3">What is Event Loop & how it works?</h1>
        <p class="text-lg">
            The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows for the execution of code in a
            non-blocking manner.

            When JavaScript code is executed, it is executed on a single thread. This means that only one piece of code
            can be executed at a time, and if a piece of code is blocking (e.g. waiting for a resource to become
            available), the entire application will be blocked until that resource is available. This can cause the
            application to become unresponsive, which is a bad user experience.

            The event loop solves this problem by allowing code to be executed in a non-blocking manner. When an event
            (such as a user click or a network request) occurs, it is added to a queue. The event loop continuously
            checks the queue for any new events, and when it finds one, it executes the associated callback function.
            Because the event loop executes code in a non-blocking manner, the application can continue to respond to
            other events while waiting for the completion of the current event.

            To summarize, the event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript code to be executed in a non-blocking
            manner by using a queue to manage events and their associated callback functions. This allows for a more
            responsive and performant application.

    <div class="bg-neutral-100 p-6 m-6 rounded-lg">
        <h1 class="text-3xl text-green-600 my-3"> quizTimer() </h1>
        <p class="text-lg">
            This function quizTimer is used to start a countdown timer that updates every second. It takes one parameter
            dismiss which is a boolean value. If the value of dismiss is true, it clears the interval set by setInterval
            and stops the timer. If dismiss is false, it sets the interval and starts the timer.

            The function uses the setInterval method to execute an anonymous function every second. This anonymous
            function updates the count and calculates the minutes and seconds to be displayed on the HTML element with
            the ID count. The count is incremented by 1 every second.

            If the count is greater than 60, it checks if it's even or odd. If it's even, it changes the color of the
            text to red, and if it's odd, it changes it to light red. The HTML content of countHtml is
            updated with the new value of min and countSec every second, along with the sec label in subscript using the
            'sub' tag.

            Overall, this function is designed to be used in a quiz or game application where a countdown timer is
            required. It updates the timer every second and can be stopped by passing a true value to the dismiss
            parameter.

    <div class="bg-neutral-100 p-6 m-6 rounded-lg">
        <h1 class="text-3xl text-green-600 my-3"> chooseQuiz() </h1>
        <p class="text-lg">
            This function chooseQuiz is used in a quiz application to update the user's answer for a specific question.
            It takes two parameters, index and givenAns. The index parameter is the index of the question in the
            quizData array for which the answer is being updated, and givenAns is the answer given by the user.

            The function first checks if the answer for the specified question already exists in the answers array. It
            does this by using the find method to search for an answer with the same id as the question being updated.
            If an answer exists, it means that the user has already answered this question before, and the function
            updates the existing answer with the new one.

            If an answer for the question doesn't exist in the answers array, it means that the user is answering the
            question for the first time. In this case, the function adds the question and the answer to the answers
            array using the push method.

            After updating the answer in the answers array, the function calls the displayAnswers function to update the
            UI with the new set of answers.

            Overall, this function is used to keep track of user's answers for a quiz application and update the UI with
            the latest set of answers.
